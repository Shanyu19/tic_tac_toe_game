# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++ that supports both **multiplayer** and **single-player** gameplay. The single-player mode features an intelligent AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

This project is a simple yet powerful implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It demonstrates the application of recursion, backtracking, and decision trees using the Minimax algorithm â€” a standard technique in AI game development. The game runs entirely in the terminal and supports:

- **Two-player mode**: Human vs Human
- **Single-player mode**: Human vs AI (Minimax)

It is ideal for learning game logic, turn-based systems, and beginner-friendly AI.
